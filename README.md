🧠 Alzheimer's MRI Dashboard
🛑 Problem
Early detection and progression monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease remains a major challenge in clinical neuroscience. Traditional methods often lack real-time insights and fail to combine quantitative MRI biomarkers with clear visual interpretation. Clinicians and researchers need tools that can integrate multiple indicators—such as image entropy, pixel intensity, and structural clarity—into a single, interactive view to better assess and compare brain scans across dementia stages.

✅ Solution
This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes MRI-derived features from patients across different stages of Alzheimer’s. Key metrics include:

Entropy levels to measure image complexity

Pixel intensity statistics for brightness distribution

Edge density and structural clarity to assess neurodegeneration

Classification of patients by cognitive status (NonDemented, MildDemented, ModerateDemented)

Top brain scan examples for both diseased and healthy cases

The dashboard uses DAX logic to normalize and combine features into a composite severity score, enabling comparative analysis across large datasets.

📊 Results
Dynamic visual insights into disease progression, scan disorder level, and radiance variation

Quick identification of high-risk scans based on composite indicators

Real-time exploration of brain scan statistics and entropy distribution

Enhanced support for decision-making in research and potential clinical environments
